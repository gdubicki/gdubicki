### Hi, I am Greg! 👋

I am a devops engineer with nearly 20 years of experience of ~breaking~ improving and fixing stuff professionally. 🧔‍♂️

I also used to be a software engineer, manager, technician and an old-school sysadmin.

I really enjoy coding in Python and I am learning Rust but I do not shy away from coding a little in Ruby, Golang and many other languages. 😊

My principle is the "boy scout rule": I try to leave the projects I encounter on my path a tiny bit better than they were before. Sometimes that ends up with a little more than a tiny bit though. 😅
